# Turso extended support

This organization contains repositories intended to support Turso in various
ways:

- Code samples
- Full projects that make use of Turso
- Tools, utilities, and libraries

These repos might be unsupported, and are provided without any promises or
guarantees.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, especially entire repos. If you have a repo to
contribute, you must observe the following requirements:

- There must be a README that:
  - Describes the purpose of the repo
  - Explains how to build and run any code
  - May attribute authorship to yourself (by mentioning yourself and linking as you prefer)
- All code must be licensed with the MIT license.
- There must be a [LICENSE file] in the root of the repo with the full MIT
  license naming "ChiselStrike, Inc." as the license holder using the current
  year.
- The name of your repo should use all lowercase letters with hyphens as word
  separators (e.g. my-awesome-turso-project). Depending on the type of repo, its
  name should:
  - Start with "app-" if it's an application or other runnable product
  - Start with "lib-" if it's a library or SDK
  - Start with "example-" if it contains code snippets or other examples
  - (or let us know if you have something else)
- The repo must not be a fork of another repo.

Steps to contribute a new repo:

1. Stage your repo on an organization you own (e.g. your personal org)
1. Reach out to us at on our [Discord] or info@turso.tech to provide a
   link and ask for a review.
1. We will review your submission, possibly offering suggestions.
1. After we accept it, you can [transfer the repo] to the turso-extended
   organization.
